//. Create Express middleware using Futures from [Fluture][].

'use strict';

const daggy = require ('daggy');
const Future = require ('fluture');
const path = require ('path');

//. ## Usage
//.
//. ```sh
//. npm install --save fluture fluture-express
//. ```
//.
//. Allows for the definition of pure functions to be used as Express
//. middleware. This has benefits for testing and developer sanity.
//. Another benefit of this particular approach, where every middleware is
//. wrapped individually, is that it plays nicely with existing Express
//. middleware, and they can be used interchangably.
//.
//. ```js
//. // index.js
//.
//. const {dispatcher} = require ('fluture-express');
//. const app = require ('express') ();
//. const dispatch = dispatcher ('./actions');
//.
//. app.use (dispatch ('welcome'));
//. app.listen (3000);
//. ```
//.
//. ```js
//. // actions/welcome.js
//.
//. const {Json} = require ('fluture-express');
//. const Future = require ('fluture');
//.
//. module.exports = (req, locals) => Future.do (function* () {
//.   const user = yield locals.database.find ('sessions', locals.session.id);
//.   return Json (200, {welcome: user.name});
//. });
//. ```
//.
//. For a more in-depth example, see the `example` directory.
//.
//. ## Documentation
//.
//. ### Pseudo types
//.
//. #### `Req`
//.
//. The Express Request object.
//.
//. #### `Res a`
//.
//. The Express Response object with a `locals` property of type `a`.
//.
//. ### The Response type
//.
//. Fluture-Express mutates the response object for you, based on a
//. specification of what the response should be. This specification is
//. captured by the Response sum-type. It has these constructors:
//.
//# Stream :: (Number, String, NodeReadableStream) -> Response a
//.
//. Indicates a streamed response. The first argument will be the response
//. status code, the second will be used as a mime type, and the third will be
//. piped into the response to form the response data.
//.
//# Json :: (Number, Object) -> Response a
//.
//. Indicates a JSON response. The first argument will be the response status
//. code, and the second will be converted to JSON and sent as-is.
//.
//# Redirect :: (Number, String) -> Response a
//.
//. Indicates a redirection. The first argument will be the response status
//. code, and the second will be the value of the Location header.
//.
//# Empty :: Response a
//.
//. Indicates an empty response. The response status will be set to 204, and
//. no response body or Content-Type header will be sent.
//.
//# Next :: a -> Response a
//.
//. Indicates that this middleware does not form a response. The supplied value
//. will be assigned to `res.locals` and the next middleware will be called.
const Response = daggy.taggedSum ('Response', {
  Stream: ['code', 'mime', 'stream'],
  Json: ['code', 'value'],
  Redirect: ['code', 'url'],
  Empty: [],
  Next: ['locals'],
});

const runAction = (name, action, req, res, next) => {
  const ret = action (req, res.locals);

  if (!Future.isFuture (ret)) {
    throw new TypeError (
      `The "${name}" action did not return a Future, instead saw:\n\n  ${ret}`
    );
  }

  ret.fork (next, val => {
    if (!Response.is (val)) {
      throw new TypeError (`The Future returned by the "${
        name
      }" action did not resolve to a Response, instead saw:\n\n  ${val}`);
    }

    val.cata ({
      Stream: (code, mime, stream) => {
        res.type (mime);
        res.status (code);
        stream.pipe (res);
      },
      Json: (code, json) => {
        res.status (code);
        res.json (json);
      },
      Redirect: (code, url) => {
        res.redirect (code, url);
      },
      Empty: () => {
        res.status (204);
        res.end ();
      },
      Next: locals => {
        res.locals = locals;
        next ();
      },
    });
  });
};

//. ### Middleware creation utilities
//.
//# middleware :: ((Req, a) -> Future b (Response a)) -> (Req, Res a, (b -> Undefined)) -> Undefined
//.
//. Converts an action to an Express middleware.
//.
//. Takes a function that returns a [Future][] of a [Response][], and returns
//. an Express middleware that uses the returned structure to make the
//. appropriate mutations to the [`res`][].
//.
//. If the Future rejects, the rejection reason is passed into `next` for
//. further [error handling with Express][].
const middleware = action => function dispatcher(req, res, next) {
  runAction (action.name || 'anonymous', action, req, res, next);
};

//# dispatcher :: String -> String -> (Req, Res a, (Any -> Undefined)) -> Undefined
//.
//. Creates middleware that uses the export from the given file in the given
//. directory as an "action".
//.
//. It takes the file in two steps for convenience. You are encouraged to use
//. the first parameter to set up a sub-directory where all your actions live.
//.
//. The exported value should be a function of the same signature as given to
//. [`middleware`][].
const dispatcher = directory => file => {
  const action = require (path.resolve (directory, file));
  return function dispatcher(req, res, next) {
    runAction (file, action, req, res, next);
  };
};

module.exports = {
  dispatcher,
  middleware,
  Response,
  Stream: Response.Stream,
  Json: Response.Json,
  Redirect: Response.Redirect,
  Empty: Response.Empty,
  Next: Response.Next,
};
